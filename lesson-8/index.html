			<h1>Robo Blasters</h1>
			<h2>Bio - Ion Storm</h2>
			<p class="threat"><q>Your time is up. Prepare to be ionized!</q></p>
			<p><img src="images/ion-storm.png" alt="Ion Storm" id="robot" /><strong>Ion Storm</strong> is by far the most intimidating and the most <em>fearsome</em> of all the Robo Blasters. Even the other bad guys are nervous around him. The <em>good</em> guys should be sure to read this bio so that they know what they are dealing with.</p>

			<p>The belligerent <strong>Ion Storm</strong> has some very serious anger management issues and has been known to fly into a rage over something as simple as someone forgetting to turn out the lights in the ordinance room. His <q>Shoot first, ask questions later</q> approach to problem solving often gets him and his teammates into unnecessary fights.</p>
			<h3>Special Powers</h3>
			<p>This very destructive <strong>Robo Blaster</strong> has the ability to focus a concentrated pulse of supercharged plasma at any target he pleases, within a range of over five hundred metres. There is not much that can withstand a blast like this.</p>
			<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
			<p>Though <em>strong</em>, <em>fast</em>, and <em>well-armed</em>, <strong>Ion Storm</strong> is very stubborn and refuses to learn new things. He often will <em>not</em> consider a different approach because, <q>That’s the way we’ve always done it.</q> His refusal to change may ultimately be his undoing.</p>
			<p class="threat"><q>I will <em>never</em> be undone! You are all doomed!</q></p>
			<h3 lang="fr">Raison d'être</h3>
			<p>To conquer the universe and enslave everyone. Obviously.</p>
