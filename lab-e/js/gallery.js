// IMPORTANT: Before you start, be sure to customize all href="" values within the server include PHP files so your site navigation works

// STEP 1: Begin by adding a SCRIPT element to 'red/gallery.php' that refers to this EXTERNAL JavaScript File

// STEP 2a: Grab the UL for #blockGallery and assign it to the variable 'blockGallery' - but use document.getElementById this time

// STEP 2b: Create an array called 'blockLinks' to contain all the A elements inside the above variable, 'blockGallery' - but use querySelectorAll instead of getElementsByTagName

// STEP 2c: Make a loop that iterates through each item in the 'blockLinks' array that you just created above

// STEP 3a: For each one of the A elements inside the array 'blockLinks', attach an onclick attribute that calls an anonymous function

// STEP 4a: For the link that was clicked, capture the value of the href attribute as a variable called 'blockHref'

// STEP 4b: Grab the IMG element just below the UL containing the links to each of the block images with the appropriate ID (look at the HTML in 'red/gallery.php') and assign it to a variable of the same name - use document.getElementById below

// STEP 4c: Change the src attribute of the above IMG element (use the variable name) using the setAttribute method, using the above 'blockHref' variable

// STEP 5a: Obtain the title attribute of the link clicked (referred to as 'this') and set it as the value for a new variable called 'blockCaption'

// STEP 5b: Create another variable called 'blockCaptionParagraph' that represents the P element with the id 'blockCaption' - use either getElementById or querySelector

// STEP 5c: Set the text of that paragraph to be equal to the value of the title attribute for the link clicked

// STEP 3c: Cancel the default behaviour of each hyperlink (which is to follow the href)

// STEP 3b: End the 'onclick' event anonymous function

// STEP 2d: End the loop through the 'blockLinks' array
